2022-2023 Intro to 3D Modeling and Animation. Univerisity of Brighton, Computer Science for Games
## Assessment 1
At the beginning of 2023, our first assessment for this course was due. For the assessment, we had to create concept art for 3 3D models that we had to subimt, along with a report. The 3D models I made for this assignment were:
- [A Knife](/Assessment_Work/scenes/Knife)
- [A Cross-Body Accessory](/Assessment_Work/scenes/CrossBodyAccessory)
- [A Sheath](/Assessment_Work/scenes/Sheath)

All of these items had to be something we wished to include in a game we wanted to make, and all had to make sense in the universe they're placed. We were told to not add lighting or textures, but I did on some of them.

I was going to remake the [Knife](/KnifeButBetter), but found that my original was good enough.

The final enviroment for the entire project is [here](https://github.com/KennedySovine/CI474_Introduction_3D_Modeling_and_Animation/blob/main/FINAL%20ASSESSEMENT%201.mb).
