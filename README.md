## Assessment 1
At the beginning of 2023, our first assessment for this course was due. For the assessment, we had to create concept art for 3 3D models that we had to subimt, along with a report. The 3D models I made for this assignment were:
- [A Knife](/Knife)
- [A Cross-Body Accessory](https://github.com/KennedySovine/CI474_Introduction_3D_Modeling_and_Animation/tree/main/CrossBody_Accessory)
